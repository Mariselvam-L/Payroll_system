Unix

clear - clears console(COMMAND)
pwd - gives current directory
cd - changes directory
ls - list all files and folders
. -  refers current
.. - refers parent
echo - prints data
sort - sorts given data 
ctrl+d - exit shell

As soon as a user of unix system logs in, he will be taken to his home directory
/home/Surya

> output redirection symbol

Creating a file:
cat > filename
contents
contents
ctrl+d

To see or view the contents of a file,
cat filename

There are some editors in ubuntu to modify or edit or change the content of a file Ex: vi,sed

If we need help about any command in unix just type 
man <command>

To copy a source file contents to a target or destination file
cp <source> <destination file>

To display long list of files
ls -l

File permission:
r - read
w - write
x - execute

U-user
G-group
O-other

Broadly files are divided into:
Data files
Program files

sh filename -  executes the file

To create a directory - mkdir directoryname

To move a file- mv <sourcefilepath> <destinationfilepath>

Administrator or root user- super user having access to all file systems

chmod command is used to grant or revoke access
chmod (u/g/o) (+/-) (r/w/x) filename

read <variable>
reads the data into a variable
read a
5
read b
2

Evaluate expressions in shell
echo expr `$a + $b`
expr- defines a expression
`- shows the start and end of expr

Shell script:It is a program file ends with .sh extension
Ex: add.sh

To execute a shellscript,
$sh <shellscript.sh>

Programming constructs:
conditional statements:
	1.if
		if test condition
		then
			<statements>
		fi
	case constructs:when we are looking for an exact match in a variable, use case
	Syntax:
		case $variable in
		pattern 1)
			statements1
			...
			statementsn
			;;
		pattern 2)
			statements1
			...
			statementsn
			;;
		*)
			statements
			...
			statementsn
			;;
		esac
			
	
condition is an expression that uses relational operators (
-gt = greater than
-ge = greater than equal
-lt = less than
-le = less than equal
-eq = equal
-ne =not equal
)
Control flow statements
Looping or iterative statements
	for
	Syntax:
		for var in list
		do 
			command1
			command2
		done
	
	while
	Syntax:
	while <condition>
	do
		Statements
	done
	
	until loop
	Syntax:
	until condition
	do 
		command 1
		command 2
	done
	
To remove a file
rm <filename>

Shell code for bigger number

clear
echo Enter first number:
read a 
echo Enter Second number:
read b
if test $a -eq $b
then
	echo "Both are equal"
elif test $a -gt $b
then
	echo "Biggest is $a"
else 
	echo "Biggest is $b"
fi

Wild card characters in unix/linux/ubuntu:
*-it replaces all the characters or none
?- it replaces only one character or non

to perform an operation on a wil group of file, we can group them by using  wild card characters
ex1:
dislay all the java programs whose name only has three charactersls ???.java

ex2:
delete all data files ending with .dat extension
rm *.dat

Processing and related comments

ps- process status(shows Process ID and process names)
A process is the execution of a set of commands. Every process created in linu has an id and name.Every command in shell is a process

df- shows disk details
Displays the disk space

who- shows people who have logged in to the subsystem
whoami- shows your details

fq- Fair queue traffic policing. It is a class less packet scheduler. All packets belonging to a socket is called flow

Top- displays

putty- a command

du- disk usage

< -  direct to input

sort -r reverse sorts

| - pipe symbol uses of output of one command as a input to next command
ex:

cat R.txt | sort -r | cat>reverse.txt

data flows from  (cat R.txt) to (sort -r) to (cat>reverse.txt)

filter- Data is filtered in desired manner by using filters in unix

Ex:
sort
more
less

>> - appends data
> - overwrites data

grep -  find a word in a file
grep "word" <filename>

grep -v excludes the word
grep -c  counts the word

The kill command senda a signal to specified processes 

9(KILL) - kill a process
1(HUP) - Reload a process
15(TERM)- Gracefully reload a process

To get a list -1

kill -1 PID NUMBERkill -SIGHUP PID NUMBERkill -HUP PID_NUMBER

Signal:
using number  -1
using sig prefix  -sighup
without sig prefix -hup

cal-shows calendar

bc - binary calculator

nice- use nice command to runa a program with modified scheduling priority/niceness
Niceness range atleast from -20(most favourable) to 19(least favorable). 

gawk- pattern scanning and programming language
AWK programming language


@include "filename"
@load "filename"
@
pattern {action statements}
fucntion name(parameter list) {statements}

export command exports variables

Ex: export myvariable

A child shell is created by sh command
There are two typed of variables in shell
1) Pre defined variables- The shell environment variables
$env
displays all environmental varaibles and their default variables

2) User defined varaibles- These variables loose their scope once we exit the current shell or create a new child shell

To avail a variable to the child shell we have to use export


Ex:

$lucky=786
$echo $lucky
786
$sh
$echo $lucky-No output
$ctrl+d (or) exit
$export lucky
$sh
$echo $lucky
786-Output is availble after export commanD

Files or data blocks where files are stored in linux is accessed using a data structure know as inodes. A file name is a pointer to the inode. Inode contains metadata of the file:

1. Pointer to the disk blocks that store the file content
2. The size of file in bytes
3. Device ID
4. User ID of the file
5. Group ID of the file
5. The file node that determines the file type and how UGO can access the file
6.Additional system and user flags to protect the file
7.Timestamps indicating when inode was last modified(ctime), file contents was modified(mtime) and when the file was accessed (atime)
8. Hardlinks containing the inode pointers


Creating hardlinks: Hardlinks are pointer to the original file itself. Even if we delete the original file hardlink will direct to the file itself so data is preserved

ln <filename> <hardlinkname>

Symbolic links- Symbolic links are similar to windows shortcuts. They just point to filename. So deletion of original file renders symboliclink useless

ln -s <filename><linkname>

awk programming
  Domain specific lanuguage designed for text processing and typically used as a data etraction and reporting tool
  
wc - wordcount
wc Filename
output: No of lines, No of words, No of characters

sed- stream editor

Syntax:
	echo "Unix is good. Unix is similar to linux" | sed 's/Unix/UNIX/'
	
Output:
UNIX is good. Unix is similar to linux

Only first output is changed

tee filter
cut filter

Write a shell script to display file or folder given as commandline argument

clear 
if test -f $1
then 
cat $1
elif test -d $1
then 
 ls $1
fi

head -1 sal
